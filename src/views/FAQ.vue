          <br>Because it is built on blockchain, actions are transparent. <br>Because it is
          built on the blockchain, actions are published forever. <br>Blockchain has promised a

        <expandable-block :title="'Can I use my Base æpp wallet for my Superhero wallet?'">
          Yes. Just choose "Retrieve Existing Account" and input your Base æpp wallet’s seed phrase.
        </expandable-block>
        <expandable-block :title="'What about other wallets?'">
          So long as you have the private keys/seed phrase for the AE address, you can use it on
          Superhero through the Retrieve Account option at start-up. For some wallets, the seed
          phrase is not in the user’s custody. In this case, the AE address cannot be used for
          Superhero.
          <br>
          <br>You can simply Generate a New Wallet on Superhero and top it up by sending AE form
          your other wallets to your Superhero wallet address.

        <expandable-block
          :title="'Can I use an AE address from a centralized exchange for my Superhero wallet?'"
        >
          No. For centralized exchanges, the exchange holds custody of users' private keys. This
          means that the user cannot use the AE address on Superhero because he/she does not have
          the private keys/seed phrase to retrieve the account.

          <br>You can simply Generate a New Wallet on Superhero and top it up by sending AE form

          Currently, users can only add short descriptions for their profile. But don’t
          despair—profile photos and avatars are coming soon!
        </expandable-block>
        <expandable-block :title="'Do I have to add my wallet address to every Tweet?'">
          No, as long as your twitter profile contains your .chain name linked to your Superhero
          wallet or Superhero wallet ae address visible in the bio, tips sent to your awesome tweets
          URL`s can be delivered to your wallet.

                  AE address on their site, will they still receive their tips?`"
        >
          Yes, as soon as they create a Superhero wallet and add their wallet address to their URL,
          tips they’ve received in the past will be added into their wallet.
