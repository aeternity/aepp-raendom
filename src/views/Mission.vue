            Introducing Superhero:
            fully P2P tipping with no boundaries, no censorship — at near-zero fees
          </h2>
          <p>
            Enabling blockchain interactions through user-friendly
            consumer applications that everyday people can actually
            use is critical to mainstream adoption. At the same time,
            blockchain technology’s promise of delivering
            a better Internet remains a promise to be fulfilled.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a solution to both of these points,
            developers have launched the Superhero wallet—which would allow users
            to send tips to anyone with an online profile, anywhere in the world.
            Users can tip their favorite content creators, musicians, artists,
            as well as support research, good causes,
            and anything on the Internet—even
            when the intended recipients don’t have the wallet yet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Superhero breaks down the current centralized state
            of content monetization platforms—wherein custodians
            can decide at any point to deny service to certain content
            creators based on their own personal prejudices.
            Superhero cannot, and will never be able to take away anyone’s ability
            to receive tips from their supporters.
            This is because Superhero is a trustless system:
            there are no custodians or third party institutions that screen transactions.
            Superhero brings people back their power
            to free transaction—a right that should have always been theirs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even better, transactions through the wallet are practically free—near-zero fees
            are possible because the payment system utilizes
            æternity blockchain’s state channels technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            In keeping with blockchain technology’s principle of transparency,
            all transactions made through Superhero are recorded on this similarly named aggregator,
            YouDoNotNeedACapeToBeAHero.com.
            The website serves as a public record through which users can read posts
            from other Superhero users,
            as well as interact and engage in discussions through comments.
            They can also reward other users for contributing to a better Internet.
          </p>
          <p>
            For those who want to get a glimpse of what the free web really looks like,
            this is the right place to start.
