            For the purposes of this ​Privacy Policy​, the terms have the following meaning:
            ● „Data Controller“ means the person or body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data;
            ● „Personal Data“ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘​USER’​);

            III. Personal data collection
            The personal data ​Superhero.com ​collects is minimized completely, selecting only those types of information, which are adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the use of ​the Website​.
            Superhero.com ​collects two main groups of personal data according to their purpose:
            3.1. Personal data in relation to indirect identifiers
            The donations and comments are conducted via the Extension Superherowallet. The Superhero wallet is a blockchain based application on which an account address is generated for user identification. Once the donation and comment are processed, they appear on the Website with a hyperlink forwarding to the website the User has tipped. ​Furthermore, other ​Users on the Website​ can additionally donate and comment on news added to the ​Website​.
            Therefore, the account address will appear on the ​Website​. The account addresses can be treated as indirect identifiers. An indirect identifier is a value which cannot be used alone to identify a data subject, however, could be identifying if combined with other indirect identifiers.
            The processing is necessary for the purpose of provision of the Service- namely the ​Website​. The retention period for the personal data is until termination of the Service provision.
            3.2. ​Personal data in relation to User support and communication
            During the use of our Website, users may decide to contact the team in relation to website support, troubleshoot problems, questions, etc. The collection of the personal data is initiated by Users and they decide what type of personal data to include in the communication.
            Therefore, the legal basis for processing is that the User has given consent to the processing of their personal data for one or more specific purposes.
            The retention period is until the questions have been answered, assistance from the team has been provided, the problems have been solved or in any other case, until withdrawal of consent. Superhero.com may retent personal information for additional period of time, if it is required by law or for crime/breach/ infringement prevention and safety.
